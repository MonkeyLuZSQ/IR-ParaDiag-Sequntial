# IR-ParaDiag-Sequntial 
CPU edition
Implementation of the serial version of the IR-ParaDiag algorithm, encompassing fixed-point iteration and preprocessing GMRES iteration.
Simultaneously, a mixed-precision algorithm is employed to solve the equations, utilizing lower precision for computations and higher precision for iterative refinement.

The current branch considers two steps to solve ParaDiag's matrix equations iteratively
